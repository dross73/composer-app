### Serve Locally

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will auto-reload on file changes.

### Build for Production

```bash
ng build --configuration production --base-href /composer-app/
```

This builds the project for GitHub Pages under the `/composer-app/` path.

## üåê Deployment

Deployment is handled via the `angular-cli-ghpages` tool:

```bash
npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/composer-app
```

This publishes the production build to the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages hosting.
